# Battlebot
 
At the end of my microcontrollers class, students formed groups of two and were able to design and build our own project with a PIC18 microcontroller. Our small battlebot, designed to fight our friend's robot, itegrates IR decoding, an H Bridge motor controller with PWM controllable speeds, four DC motors, and two servos.
